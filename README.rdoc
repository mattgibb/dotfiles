= Matt Gibb's Dot Files

These are config files to set up a system the way I like it.

If you've got any good config file banter and would like to share it
with me, drop me an email, send me a patch or fork this and send me
a pull request :-)

== Installation

If you have ruby installed:

  git clone git://github.com/mattgibb/dotfiles ~/.dotfiles
  cd ~/.dotfiles
  rake install


== Environment

I am running on Mac OS X, but it will likely work on Linux as well with 
minor fiddling. I primarily use zsh, but this includes some older bash 
files as well. If you would like to switch to zsh, you can do so with 
the following command.

  chsh -s /bin/zsh


== Features

If you're using git, you'll notice the current branch name shows up in
the prompt while in a git repository, in green for a clean status and
in red otherwise.
